# Landmark Detection and Robot Tracking (SLAM)

Did this project as a part of the requirements for the graduation of the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree Implemented SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) specifically Graph-SLAM for a general 2 dimensional world. Combined robot sensor measurements and movement model to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time by calculating Omega and Xi constraint matrices incorporating elements of uncertainty, probability and linear algebra.
